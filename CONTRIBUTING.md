## Filing bug reports and feature requests

The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can be about the problem.

Please check old issues first to see if your question has already been answered.

If not, then please provide the exact version of the package that you're using along with a detailed explanation of the issue and complete steps to reproduce the problem. Issues that don't provide enough information to reproduce will be closed.

Please ensure all sample code is properly formatted and readable. Issues that don't include all necessary code (or a sample project) to reproduce will be closed.

We do our best to respond to all bug reports and feature requests, but the project is maintained on a voluntary basis and we cannot guarantee how quickly these will be looked at.

## Contributing Code

Please open an issue to discuss new feature requests before submitting a Pull Request. This allows the maintainers to discuss whether your feature is a suitible fit for the project before any code is written. Please don't open a pull request without first discussing whether the feature fits with the project roadmap.

## Building the code

See `Build` section in the [README](../README.MD)

## Contributing code and content

Make sure you can build the code. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests.

If you wish to submit a new feature, please open an issue to discuss it with the project maintainers - don't open a pull request without first discussing whether the feature fits with the project roadmap.

Tests must be provided for all pull requests that add or change functionality.

Please ensure that you follow the existing code-style when adding new code to the project. This may seem pedantic, but it makes it much easier to review pull requests when contributed code matches the existing project style. Specifically:

- Please ensure that your editor is configured to use spaces for indentation, not tabs.
